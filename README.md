# Data Analytics & Automation Pipeline

## Project Overview
An automated Data Analytics Pipeline built in Python designed to ingest, clean, and process security event logs. It utilizes **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for automated visual chart generation, exporting structured JSON summary reports.

# 🚀 Python Workshop: Capstone Project

Welcome to the **Python Workshop Capstone Project**! This project serves as the final, comprehensive assessment of your journey through the workshop. It is designed to combine core programming fundamentals with practical software development workflows, problem-solving, and data handling.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

For this capstone, students are required to design, build, and document a fully functional Python application. The project must solve a real-world problem or streamline a business process, demonstrating mastery of the core Python concepts covered throughout the workshop.

### 💡 Project Ideas & Scope
You may choose one of the following tracks or propose a custom project (subject to instructor approval):
1. **Data Analytics & Automation Pipeline**: Fetch data from an external API or dynamic CSV/JSON dataset, perform data cleaning and transformation using Pandas, and generate automated visual reports/summaries.
2. **Interactive CLI / Utility Tool**: Build an interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) application with persistent data storage (SQLite or file-based JSON/CSV), robust user input validation, and modular structure.
3. **Web Scraper & Analysis Tool**: Construct an ethical web scraping tool (using `BeautifulSoup` or `requests`), parse and store structured data, and output insights/metrics to the user.
4. **Task/Inventory Management System**: Develop an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) system managing entities, state, transactions, and historical reporting.

## 🛠️ Required Technical Components

To pass the capstone project, your codebase **must** incorporate the following elements:

* **Modular Code Architecture**: Clear organization across separate modules/files (e.g., `main.py`, `models.py`, `utils.py`, `data_handler.py`).
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** or Functional Paradigms: Effective use of custom classes, methods, encapsulated state, or pure functional structures.
* **Data Persistence**: Ability to read from and write to external files (`.csv`, `.json`, `.txt`) or a relational database (`SQLite`).
* **Error Handling & Input Validation**: Implementation of `try-except` blocks to handle edge cases, missing files, API rate limits, and invalid user inputs gracefully.
* **External Package / API Integration**: Utilization of standard libraries alongside third-party modules (e.g., `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `rich`, or `pytest`).
* **Clean & Readable Code**: PEP 8 compliance, informative variable/function naming, concise comments, and explicit docstrings for major functions/classes.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Your final submission repository should adhere to a clean layout similar to this:

```text
